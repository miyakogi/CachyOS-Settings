# CachyOS-Settings
This repository contains configuration files that tweak sysctl values, add udev rules to automatically set schedulers, and provide additional optimizations.

NOTE: Modified for by miyaco (miyakogi@github.com)

## udev rules
- ZRAM tuning
- Audio latency
- SATA Active Link Power Management for HDD to prioritize max performance 
- IO schedulers, automatic selection schedulers depends on your HW - SATA SSD, NVME and HDD.
- NVIDIA, load, unload modules and set-up power management. 

## sysctl
- Tweaks focused to memory and network.
- Low Memory Optimizer (le9uo) patched by firelzrd. The optimal values ​​are configured automatically.

## modprobe
- NVIDIA and enable direct rendering
- Force using of the amdgpu driver for Southern Islands (GCN 1.0+) and Sea Islands (GCN 2.0+).

## systemd
- PCI latency
- Disable LRU_GEN when possible to start le9

## Scripts
- Easily switch between amdpstate-epp and amdpstate-guided
- Upload logs with paste-cachyos, for example: sudo dmesg | paste-cachyos
- View up to 10 process memory/swap usage (topmem)
- Tune CFS on the fly with tunecfs (classic, default, BORE values) (only compatible with linux-lts due to being dropped)
